- Session start: New session initiated and startup sequence completed.
- User: "마스터 사미사" identified as preferred display for '대영 마스터' rename.
- Actions performed:
  - Guided user on uploading files via chat and Telegram (@youngD_bot).
  - Assisted with Google Cloud service account JSON usage: walk-through of creating service account, assigning roles, downloading JSON, using GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS, and running seed script for Firestore.
  - Helped run seed-projects.js; fixed path issue (~ expansion) and missing npm "seed" script guidance. User executed node seed-projects.js successfully; upsert logs showed projects and works inserted.
  - Verified Firestore projects/works entries; upserted and deleted duplicate 'stock_po'. Added project 'stock_po' then deleted per user request. Read and summarized projects and works.
  - Created auto-add meeting document meet-20260224-2129 under projects/bip/works describing photo portfolio planning; action items assigned (A1 Master: select 12 images; A2 Alfred: create Next.js template; A3 Design: produce two layout mockups).
  - Scaffolded photo-portfolio Next.js starter in workspace (/Users/dyno/daeyoung-openclaw-main/photo-portfolio), created README, package.json, pages, styles, image optimization script (sharp), Git commit, CI workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
  - User uploaded images via Finder to upload/sample-series; optimized images to public/images via script; started local dev server; implemented gallery and works pages; fixed parsing bugs and Link usage; restarted dev server; converted home layout to Magazine Grid per user request.
  - Added content templates and sample-series content; created meeting design doc meet-design-20260224-2154 in Firestore (attempted; some earlier write errors but final doc created).
  - Renamed occurrences of "대영 마스터" to "마스터 사미사" across local repo and committed; pulled/rebased and pushed to origin main; user requested deploy to ing.324.ing but GitHub Actions deploys failed due to missing GCP_CREDENTIALS secret; updated Firestore desc to new text; advised on deployment options.
  - Investigated Telegram sync issues: scanned Firestore chat_logs, attempted to find recent pings (ping-2231) but no matching entries; recommended checks (bot membership, webhook, logs). Confirmed chat_logs collection exists with 1464 docs.
  - Set up plan for multi-bot topic routing: user chose option 4 (separate bots per topic). Prepared to create bots with dyno_ prefix and Vercel hosting. User created bots and will add tokens to GitHub Secrets; repository created at https://github.com/nohdaeyoung/daeyoung-dyno-bots; provided secret names and instructions.
  - External volumes: found /Volumes/사진 and /Volumes/사진작업; prepared to scan for Canon A70 images but exiftool and Pillow not installed; proposed installing exiftool to scan and copy top candidates to portfolio selected folder.

- Outstanding action items (user-directed):
  - User to add BotFather tokens to GitHub Secrets for dyno_* bots (or provide tokens temporarily).
  - Decide webhook hosting (user chose Vercel) and provide GitHub repo access or allow assistant to create repo; assistant prepared template.
  - User to confirm whether to allow assistant to install exiftool and perform Canon A70 scan/copy.

- Privacy/security notes:
  - Service account JSON is sensitive; advised deleting from console after use and removing local copies.
  - Bot tokens are sensitive; recommended adding to GitHub Secrets and rotating after use.
